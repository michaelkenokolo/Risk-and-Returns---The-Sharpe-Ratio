# Risk-and-Returns---The-Sharpe-Ratio
The Sharpe Ratio has been one of the most popular risk/return measures in finance created by Professor William Sharpe. It is used to calculate the difference in returns for two investments. A higher ratio means that the reward will be higher for a given amount of risk. In this notebook, the S&P 500 index was used as a benchmark to calculate the Sharpe Ratio between Facebook and Amazon to decide which stock investors should buy. 

The `stock_data` and `benchmark_data` datasets were used to conduct exploratory analysis on both Facebook and Amazon stock performances in 2016.
