# Risk-and-Returns---The-Sharpe-Ratio
The Sharpe ratio (created by William Sharpe) has been one of the most popular risk/return measures in finance. It is used to calculate the difference in returns for two investments. A higher ratio means that the reward will be higher for a given amount of risk. In this notebook, the S%P 500 index was used as benchmark to calculate the Sharpe Ratio between Facebook and Amazon to decide which stock investors should buy.
